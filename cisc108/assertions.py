'''
CISC106 Module that includes some basic helper functions such as assert_equal().

Versions:
0.2 - 2019-JAN-02, Modified by Austin Cory Bart
 + Renamed functions to be in line with common Python convention
 + Packaged into an actual library on PyPI, with tests and stuff.
 + Replaced type(X) checks with isinstance
 + Changed string interpolation to .format
 + Extracted out string messages
0.142 - 2014-APR-23, Modified by Jon Leighton
 + Modified success and failure messages to print "SUCCESS" and "FAILURE" at the
   beginning of each result. This makes it much easier to quickly discern the
   outcome visually.
0.141 - 2014-MAR-26, Modified by Jon Leighton
 + Removed unused function print_verbose().
 + Appended text to FAILURE message for incompatible types to indicate that types
   involved can't be compared.
0.14 - 2014-MAR-26, Modified by Andrew Roosen
 + Modified assert_equal() to return False on failure and True on success.
 + Introduced QUITE option to supress output on SUCCESS.
 + Modified FAILURE message for incompatible data types to be consistent with
 + FAILURE message for unequal values.
 + Modified names of internal functions isEqual() and isseqtype() to _is_equal()
   and _is_seq_type(), respectively
0.13 - 2014-MAR-25, Modified by Jon Leighton
 + added elif clause to _is_equal(), to avoid comparing ints and floats to anything
   that is not an int or a float, and to return None in this case. The previous
   comparison tried to subtract these quantities from each other, causing a
   runtime error.
 + Modified assert_equal() to check for _is_equal() returning None, which now
   indicates an attempt to compare unrelated data types. Failure message is
   modified in this case to report the attempt to compare unrelated types.
 + Removed unused global variables fail and success.
 + Added version numbers to Paul Amer's modifications, and bumped version number to
   reflect my modifications.
 + Changed version number to string, to match recommended practice.
0.122 - 2012-APR-17, Modified by Paul Amer
 + removed graphics stuff; just kept assert_equal
0.121 - 2011-SEP-08, Modified by Paul Amer
 +improved success-failure messages
0.12
 + display can be called multiple times
 + assert_equal supports PIL.Image.Image
0.1
 + Initial assert_equal, display, animate, bind

    Checks an expected value using the _is_equal function.

    Args:
        x (Any): Any kind of python value. Should have been computed by
            the students' code (their actual answer).
        y (Any): Any kind of python value. The expected value to be produced,

        precision (int): Optional. Indicates how many decimal places to use
            when comparing floating point values.
        exact_strings (bool): Whether or not strings should be matched perfectly
            character-by-character, or if you should ignore capitalization,
            whitespace, and symbols.
